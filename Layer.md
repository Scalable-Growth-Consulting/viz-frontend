## 🔑 Auth & API Gateway Layer  
- **Supabase Auth**: Good choice; you offload account management. Your **Lambda Authorizer** should verify Supabase JWTs before passing traffic into your system.  
- **API Gateway**: Handles rate limiting, request validation, CORS, and routing.  
- **EC2 lifecycle mgmt**: Spinning up EC2s on-demand is possible but can be slow (30–90s cold starts). Consider:  
            - Run Node + Python backends in **ECS on Fargate** → containers spin up in ~5s and autoscale.

## 🖥️ Backend Layer  
### Node.js (real-time, APIs, integrations)  
- Best for **low-latency APIs**, ad platform connectors, dashboards, alerts.  
- Hook in DynamoDB/Redis for real-time queries.  
- Use SQS/Kinesis → decouple event ingestion from heavy processing.  

### Python (data/ML)  
- Best for **ETL/AI workloads**.  
- Run as:  
  - **Batch**: Glue jobs, SageMaker Processing jobs, or Step Functions.  
  - **Service**: Lightweight **FastAPI in ECS/Fargate** or even Lambda (if cold starts aren’t an issue).  
- Keep ML inference services separate so Node.js can call them via internal APIs.

## 📊 Data Layer (your current plan: DynamoDB + Redis)  
Let’s examine:  

1. **DynamoDB** (NoSQL, serverless, global scale)  
   - ✅ Great for user state, session data, auth metadata, hot dashboards.  
   - ✅ Millisecond latency, scales automatically.  
   - ❌ Query flexibility is limited (must design keys well).  
   - ❌ Not great for **ad analytics (aggregations, joins, time-series)**.  

2. **Redis (ElastiCache)**  
   - ✅ Excellent cache for hot queries, counters, session storage.  
   - ✅ Works well with alerts engine (fast rule eval).  
   - ❌ Not your source of truth — just a performance booster.  

3. **Recommended Additional DBs (depending on workload)**  
   - **Postgres (RDS or Aurora Serverless)** → For relational queries, campaign configs, audit logs.  
   - **Redshift** → For large-scale analytics (ad impressions, clicks, spend rollups). You can ETL raw events → Redshift via Glue or Kinesis Firehose.  
   - **OpenSearch (managed Elasticsearch)** → For search/filter heavy workloads (campaign logs, event search).  
   - **S3** → Cold storage of raw events (JSON/Parquet) → data lake for ML.  

👉 A good mix:  
- **DynamoDB**: Hot path (real-time dashboards, user states).  
- **RDS Postgres**: Relational state (configs, transactions, billing).  
- **S3 + Redshift**: Analytics lakehouse (historical ad data, ML training sets).  
- **Redis**: Caching + rules engine.

## 🛡️ Security & Scalability Touchpoints  
- **Supabase JWTs**: Validate via Lambda Authorizer at the edge → principle of least privilege.  
- **VPC isolation**: Node/Python backends in private subnets, API Gateway → Lambda in public.  
- **Service Mesh (optional)**: If you go ECS, consider App Mesh for observability + service-to-service security.  
- **Scalability**:  
  - Event ingestion via **Kinesis/SQS** ensures backpressure handling.  
  - ML workloads scale with **SageMaker** instead of manually spinning EC2s.  
  - Data tier autoscaling: DynamoDB auto scaling + Aurora Serverless v2.  

---

✅ **TL;DR suggestion for data layer:**  
Keep **DynamoDB + Redis** for hot path, but also add:  
- **Aurora Postgres** for configs/transactions.  
- **S3 + Redshift** for analytics/ML training.  
This way you cover: real-time, relational, and analytical workloads.
